  <h1>Welcome the the Citibike Visualizer tool</h1>
  <p>This tool allows you to see the average amount of Citibikes available at Citibike stations over the course of a 24 hour period. The graphs show the average, maximum, and minimum Citibikes at stations throughout New York City. You have the ability to sort the graphs to show all of NYC, only Manhattan or Brooklyn, or any postal code where a Citibike station is located.</p>
